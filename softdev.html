          You know that smartphone app you rely on? That computer game that kept you
           transfixed for hours as a kid? That program that helps you budget and track expenditures?
           Software developers created all of them.
          Software developers are the creative, brainstorming masterminds behind computer programs of all sorts.
           While some software developers may focus on a specific program or app,
            others create giant networks or underlying systems that help trigger and power other programs.
             This is why there are two main classifications of developers:
              applications software developers and systems software developers.

  <h2>
    How do you get started?
  </h2>
  <p>
    In order to get a well-rounded education and a holistic understanding of all things computer science, it will be important for you to learn about each of these subject areas as you go through your journey to become a computer scientist. Every good computer scientists has studied the following areas in some form.



  It’s also a good idea to pick one or two that highly interest you and delve even deeper into these areas of study so you become an expert in a specific field. It’s impossible to be an expert in everything, so choosing a specialization is helpful.

  <h3>Find what your inner self's really upto, today.</h3>
<p>
  A good programmer knows he does not know it all, but he is confident he can manage and figure out a way to make almost everything work.

He likes to work with a small team, as a few brains can solve better than one.
He likes to help others and to invest time keeping alignment, as that is the only way to make progress in a team.

He considers the intended use more important than the specifications and if in doubt he will ask to a knowledgeable person (customer, product owner/manager or the best proxy for knowledge on what the product should help doing).

When writing code he will go a loooong way to just keep it simple, or at least as simple as possible, even at the cost of cutting out unlikely to be used scenarios (after convincing the relevant stakeholders by explaining the pros / cons).

The most important consideration in his code is to keep it readable for himself and fellow colleagues, actively using naming and the language features. He does not need comments to tell what the code does: that being so obvious to read from the code itsel.

He is always very conscious of the “least surprise” paradigm, i.e. the names of class, method, function, variable or everything else should provide clear information that should be enough to understand what that thing does / is.
As a corollary he might add comments to explain WHY something is done in a way that is not the most obvious.
